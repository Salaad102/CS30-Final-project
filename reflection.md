what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- start early and get an idea
- ask more questions when you can't figure things out


did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
- most things, however I ran out of time to implement some things: (shovel, moving zombies)

What was the hardest part of the project?
- finding out how to remove a specific sprite.

Were there any problems you could not solve?
- how to refund the purchase of a plant if you didn't place it in the correct spot
